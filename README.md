# moviedbAPI

Contained is the zip file with the full project which uses JS, HTML, CSS and the MovieDB API to make a site where the user can search for movies and will get descriptions on hover. If clicked, a large size image of the poster as well as additional info is displayed to the user. Additionally, if the user searches for something that does not exist, a message pops up telling the user that their query was not found.

Additional comments on the structure of the code...
  >I utilized eventListeners in the js file which check if the mouse is hovering over specific movies, or if the user clicks on a movie.
  >id main in the html document is where all changes take place in the page.
  >element el and el2(larger display of one movie) are the general elements that all other elements are attached to. If the larger display is active, main will have the child el2, otherwise el1.
