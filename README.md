# moviedbAPI

Contained is the zip file with the full project which uses JS, HTML, CSS and the MovieDB API to make a site where the user can search for movies and will get descriptions on hover. If clicked, a large size image of the poster as well as additional info is displayed to the user. Additionally, if the user searches for something that does not exist, a message pops up telling the user that their query was not found.
